a trivial quantum chemistry code for HF and DFT calculations, written mainly in c language.
the one and two center integral was also implemented, of course.



an old code development around 2007.5-2008.6, this is only a test tools when i was studying the Quantum Chemistry.

this may improve to a useful tools.

update is required later..
