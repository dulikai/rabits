a trivial quantum chemistry code for HF and DFT calculations, written mainly in C language.
the one and two center integral was also implemented, of course.

most of the code exactly follow the designing idea of Gaussian program.
If no special action is required, the code seems to give similar results as Gaussian up-to 10e-14 accuracy, even when the DIIS or EDIIS is used.

Attention, this code has not been tested with very large molecule system.

an old code development around 2007.5-2008.6, this is only a test tools when i was learning Quantum Chemistry.

update is required later..
